### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: How to Build a Responsive UI Component Using Element Queries 
#### Instructor: [Louie R](https://tutsplus.com/authors/lourfield)

In this tutorial we’ll continue our discussion about element queries, turning our hand to building a reusable responsive component.

To recap, element queries enable us to mould an element based on its container’s characteristics; the width, height and so on. But it’s worth pointing out that element queries are a long way off becoming a CSS standard, and we’ll probably have to wait for a couple of years before that happens.

So, for now, we will have to resort to a JavaScript library to emulate similar functionality, such as EQCSS.
